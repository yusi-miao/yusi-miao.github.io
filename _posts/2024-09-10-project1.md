## Project Goal
To develop an advanced clinical OCT imaging technique to identify novel biomarkers of tumor-specific changes to melanin contents.

## Strategies
We develop a simplified PS-OCT device (called polarization-diversity OCT) tailored for clinical imaging of choroidal tumor, which generate additional contrast of pigment-containing structures in the eye.

## Outcome
Over the past 3 years, we screened more than 300 patients using the clinical-prototype PS-OCT device, establishing a large database of tumor pigmentation along with standard ophthalmic imaging tools (Fundus, SLO).
